# jQLite - a jQuery Stand-in for BlackBerry (and other mobile devices) #

First off... This isn't jQuery.  If you're looking for jQuery, please visit http://jquery.org

## jQLite v1.1.1 has been tagged ##

_New performance improvement!_ (see [the Wiki page](http://code.google.com/p/jqlite/wiki/PerformanceImprovement) for more info)

This is intended to be a stand-in for jQuery on mobile devices that aren't as capable as those with more advanced browsers.  It was created out of a need to get jQuery-like functionality working on a BlackBerry mobile browser.  The selector engine is extremely simple, only supporting Id, element, class, simple decendent, and attribute selectors.

Only a subset of the jQuery functionality is supported.  Straighforward JavaScript is used to implement most of the functionality.  Some code from jQuery has been used to implement needed functionality.  Many thanks to John Resig and the jQuery team for making their code available as open source.

For more information about what is supported, please see the [Wiki pages](http://code.google.com/p/jqlite/w/list).  If you're interested in contributing to this project, please drop me an email.

_Disclaimer:_ While every precaution is used to make sure that compatibility between jQLite and jQuery are maintained, some things may be different.
