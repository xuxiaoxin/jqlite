# Mobile Devices that jQLite Works On #

The following devices have been tested with jQLite:

  * iPhone, iPod Touch
  * Android
  * Blackberry 8330, 8530, 9700, etc. (with OS v4.6+)
  * webOS (PalmPre, Palm pixi)

After further testing on the Blackberry platform, I have determined that the 4.6+ version of the browser, while capable, is not the best upon which to rely.  As it stands, I would recommend a v5.0 or higher version of the browser when developing for the Blackberry.

## Devices Tested - Not Functional ##

  * IEMobile 6
  * IEMobile 6.5

## Additional Testing ##

jQLite has been tested on Windows in Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  It is not functional in Internet Explorer (at the moment) due to the way events are attached to elements.
